<h1>Rail Assist</h1>

<h3>WHAT IS RAIL ASSIST? </h3>
Rail Assist is a platform that tracks disabled rail users in real-time as they travel on trains. Users create a user profile with their name, photo and special requirements, which is then sent to station staff, who are kept updated on the location of the passenger and notified there is a delay, change of platform or missed train.
